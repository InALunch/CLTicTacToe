"Command Line Tic Tac Toe"

-Really straightforward command-line TicTacToe

-You can play against another human, against an AI, or even pit two AIs against each other!

-To play a game:
   Simply go to the right folder in the command line, and run "python TTT2.py" if you want a 1v1 against the AI!
   
-Alternatively,
   Run "python TTT2.py modes" if you want to see more game modes!
   
Notes: 

The AI is *almost* perfect. An earlier version of this program had an AI that was actually perfect, but I figured it'd be more interesting game if the human has a possibility of winning!
